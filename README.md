**A project of [Densa Labs](https://densa-labs.github.io).**

[Benchmark Registry](https://benchmarkregistry.org) puts AI models and their benchmark results in one place. It solves a simple, common problem: benchmark results are scattered across model announcements, benchmark sites, companies and evaluators.

## What is Benchmark Registry?

Benchmark Registry is an ever-updating, open-source, free-to-use public registry of AI models and their benchmark results. Every result links to its primary source.

It tracks:

- **Companies and model developers**
- **Models and model families**
- **Reasoning or effort settings** recorded with each result
- **Benchmark versions and metrics**
- **Evaluators**
- **Sources and reported dates**

Benchmark results are sourced from primary sources:

- **Official benchmark or evaluator results**
- **Official model developer system cards, technical reports, or blogs**

## Registry numbers

Models receive stable Registry numbers based on their provider namespace and the order in which they are added to the Registry. ***(Ex. 10006 GPT-5.3-Codex)***

### Namespace allocation

```text
00  = Stealth models
10  = OpenAI
15  = OpenAI OSS
20  = Anthropic
30  = Google
35  = Google Gemma
40  = SpaceXAI
50  = Cursor
60  = NVIDIA
70  = Microsoft
80  = Meta
90  = Mistral
100 = reserved; intentionally unallocated
110 = DeepSeek
120 = Moonshot AI
130 = Alibaba
140 = MiniMax
150 = Z.ai
160 = Thinking Machines
170 = SSI
```

### Numbering rules

- A Registry No. is the namespace prefix followed by a three-digit sequence (001–999).
- Published numbers never change and are never reused.
- A new model takes the next free sequence in its namespace. A model released before already-numbered ones is added at the end as a late backfill.
- A new number means a separately released model; renames and API aliases stay aliases of the existing number.
- Namespace 00 holds stealth models, which may later redirect to their confirmed number.
- A namespace can be allocated before its company has any models in the Registry; SSI's is.
